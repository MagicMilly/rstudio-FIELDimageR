# RStudio-FIELDimageR

FIELDimageR in a RStudio container with `VICE` dependencies, based on [Vice RStudio Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/cyversevice/rstudio-verse) for CyVerse VICE.

These instructions will cover how to use the CyVerse VICE app, which does not require installing any software on your local machine. This is the recommended method for generating GEOJson plot files for most users. For developers who are familiar with Docker and RStudio and are interested in contributing to the pipeline and/or writing custom algorithms, skip to the [Development](#development) section. 

## Overview

The original documentation for [FIELDimageR](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/FIELDimageR) provides information on its capabilities.

This documentation is for writing [GeoJSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7946/?include_text=1) plot files by leveraging the functionality inherent in FIELDimageR.

There is a non-CyVerse Docker image available named [agdrone/fieldimager](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/agdrone/fieldimager).
Refer to the [rocker/rstudio](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio) instructions for running this Docker image.

## Prerequisites 

# Quick Start

Use the following steps to quickly get started with the CyVerse app:
1. Log into [CyVerse](https://de.cyverse.org/de/) Discovery Environment
2. Click on the Apps tile to open the `Apps` window
3. If needed, find the FIELDimageR app
4. Click on the name of the app to open the FIELDimageR analysis launch window
5. Specify a folder containing the source image(s) in the `Sources` section of the analysis launch window
6. Click the `Launch Analysis` button to start the app
7. Wait for a CyVerse notification with the text: `access your running analysis here`
8. Click the link and wait until the CyVerse login screen appears
9. Log into CyVerse with your credentials
10. Log into the RStudio instance using the username `rstudio` and password `rstudio1` credentials
11. Follow the instructions in the [preparation step](#preparation) to generate the plot GeoJSON file

# Docker Instructions

## Run this Docker locally or on a Virtual Machine

To run these containers, you must first pull them from DockerHub.

```
docker pull agdrone/cyverse_fieldimager:latest
```

```
docker run --rm -v /$HOME:/app --workdir /app -p 8787:80 -e REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8787 agdrone/cyverse_fieldimager:latest
```

#### Local Credentials

The default username is `rstudio` and password is `rstudio1`.
To reset the password, add the flag `-e PASSWORD=<yourpassword>` in the `docker run` statement (replacing \<yourpassword\> with the actual password).

## Build your own Docker container and deploy on CyVerse VICE

A pre-built container is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/agdrone/cyverse_fieldimager).

The built container is intended to run on the CyVerse data science workbench, called [VICE](https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html). 

##### Developer notes

To build your own container with a Dockerfile and additional dependencies, get the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Chris-Schnaufer/rstudio-FIELDimageR) from the GitHub repository.

Next, [build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) the Docker image using a command line prompt.

A sample command line is shown next; you will need to replace parameters for your environment.
```bash
docker build -t agdrone/cyverse_fieldimager:1.0 -f 1.0.0/Dockerfile ./
```
The following parameters are:
* `docker` this is the Docker command to run
* `build` instructions docker to build an image
* `-t` indicates that the tag (name) of the image follows
* `agdrone/cyverse_fieldimager:1.0` the tag of the built image; this name should be changed for your environment
* `-f` indicates that the path of the Dockerfile to use follows
* `1.0.0/Dockerfile` the relative path to the Dockerfile to use; the path to the Dockerfile may be different on your system
* `./` indicates that the current folder is to be used as needed

Once the Docker image is built, [docker push](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/) can be used to upload the image to where CyVerse VICE can access it.
The following command uploads the image built in the previous step to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
You will need to replace the image tag in the following command with the one specified previously.
```bash
docker push agdrone/cyverse_fieldimager:1.0
```

Follow the instructions in the [VICE manual for integrating your own tools and apps](https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/developer_guide/building.html).

# Running the VICE app <a name="vice"/>

Additional information is available in the CyVerse [RStudio Quick Start](https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/vice/en/latest/user_guide/quick-rstudio.html) documentation. 

#### VICE Credentials

If running the docker image on VICE, the default username is `rstudio` and password is `rstudio1`.

# Generating Plot GeoJSON File
This document describes how to use [FIELDimageR](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/FIELDimageR) to generate a Plot boundary [GeoJSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7946/?include_text=1) file.

These instructions assume that you have access to a running Docker container that already has the requirements for FIELDimageR installed.
Refer to the [installation](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/FIELDimageR#Instal) instructions if needed.

We will only be referencing the minimum steps needed for generating the GeoJSON file.
There is additional functionality available with FIELDimageR.

## Preparation Steps <a name="preparation" />

This section lists the steps needed to define the plot boundaries ([saving the plot geometries](#generate) follows).

<hr />

The steps used here are a non-consecutive subset of those available with FIELDimageR with additional commands added.

- [2. Select the targeted field from the original image](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/FIELDimageR#2-selecting-the-targeted-field-from-the-original-image)
- [3. Rotating the image](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/FIELDimageR#3-rotating-the-image)
- [5. Building the plot shape file](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/FIELDimageR#5-building-the-plot-shape-file)

<hr />

We are using an example source image named [EX1_RGB.tif](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S9MyX12De94swjtDuEXMZKhIIHbXkXKt/view).
You can substitute the name of any georeferenced image file you'd like.

**Specify libraries needed**

Load the needed libraries
```R
library(FIELDimageR)
library(raster)
library(geojsonio)
library(stringi)
```

**Load the image**

Load the source image with the following command.
```R
EX1<-stack("EX1_RGB.tif")
```

**Crop to field of interest**

Run the following step to crop the image to the field.
This will make it easier to specify the plot boundaries.
```R
EX1.Crop <- fieldCrop(mosaic = EX1)
```

**Rotate the image**

The cropped image needs to be rotated so that the columns are vertically aligned (facing  "up).
The `clockwise` parameter is shown as having a `F` (False) value indicating counter-clockwise rotation.
If you need clockwise rotation, or your attempts to vertically align the columns isn't working out, try setting the parameter to `T` (True).
```R
EX1.Rotated<-fieldRotate(mosaic = EX1.Crop, clockwise = F)
```

**Restore Geographic information**

The rotation may have changed the geographic information for the image.
The following commands ensures it's correct.
```R
crs(EX1.Rotated)<-crs(EX1.Crop)
extent(EX1.Rotated)<-extent(EX1.Crop)
```

**Defining the plot boundaries**

Now that the image is prepared the plot boundaries can be defined.

Be sure to specify the correct count of columns (`ncols`) and rows (`nrows`) for your field.

```R
EX1.Shape<-fieldShape(mosaic = EX1.Rotated, ncols = 14, nrows = 9)
```

## Generate GeoJSON file <a name="generate" />

The following code takes the plot boundaries produced in the [Preparation](#preparation) section above and writes the GeoJSON to a file named 'plots.json'.

Ensure coordinate system of polygons is in the expected Lat-Long WGS84 (EPSG 4326).
```R
latlon_crs<-crs('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs')
latlon_shape<-spTransform(EX1.Shape$fieldShape, latlon_crs)
```

Generate and write the JSON:
```R
json<-geojson_json(latlon_shape)
save_json<-gsub('fieldID', 'id', json)
geojson_write(save_json, geometry="polygon", file="plots.json", precision=9)
```

## Save the Rotated Image

The plot boundaries generated are for the rotated image that they were created on.
For plot boundary-to-image mapping to be correct, the rotated image needs to be saved.
The following command saves the rotated image:
```R
writeRaster(EX1.Rotated, "EX1_RGB_rotated.tif", overwrite=TRUE, datatype='INT1U', format='GTiff')
```
